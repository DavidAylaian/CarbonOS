# Carbon Code of Conduct

## Expected Behavior
When working in the project space or publicly representing the project, contributors shall:
- Refrain from name-calling, rudeness, and harrassment of any kind
- Be understanding of others who don't know English very well
- Assume good intentions and not act overly-defensive
- Not intentionally spam irrelevant and unhelpful information

## Enforcement
This code of conduct is not legally binding. Project maintainers always have the final say in judging whether someone has violated the code of conduct and the proper consequences they will face, up to and including a permanent ban. Anyone asked by a maintainer to stop doing something is expected to comply immediately.
